**Web Application (Streamlit):**  
This project also features a Streamlit-based web app, where users can input values to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The web app provides an easy interface to interact with the model.

üìä **Project Workflow**  
- **Data Loading:** Data collected from the Scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset.  
  - Includes 30 features describing tumor characteristics.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Summary statistics, feature distributions, and correlation analysis.  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Standardization for neural network training.  
  - Outlier detection and handling.  
- **Model Training:**  
  - Logistic Regression for baseline performance.  
  - Neural Networks for advanced performance.  
- **Prediction System:**
