# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Classification

This project leverages **Logistic Regression** and **Neural Networks** to classify breast cancer cases as either malignant or benign using the **Breast Cancer Dataset** from the Scikit-learn library. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare to assist in early diagnosis and decision-making.

- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Dataset from Scikit-learn with 569 samples and 30 features.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Logistic Regression for quick and interpretable classification.
  - Neural Networks for improved accuracy and performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Standardization of features.
  - Removal of unnecessary columns.
  - Handling class imbalance.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Feature distributions.
  - Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
  - Outlier detection using box plots.
- **Performance**:
  - Logistic Regression:
    - Training Accuracy: `94.7%`
    - Test Accuracy: `95.6%`
  - Neural Network:
    - Training Accuracy: `96.6%`
    - Test Accuracy: `95.6%`
  - Neural network performance improves with each epoch, reducing loss and increasing accuracy.

**Web Application (Streamlit):**  
This project also features a Streamlit-based web app, where users can input values to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The web app provides an easy interface to interact with the model.
